# Inca

> Light-weight proof-of-stake BFT consensus.

## Introduction

Inca is an attempt to implement an ultra-lightweight Proof-Of-Stake blockchain.

 - Validators are assigned voting power, and vote on block proposals.
 - Transactions, blocks, and other data are all stored in IPFS.
 - The protocol exchanges IPFS hash references for most data.
 
This repo contains documentation and the protocol.
